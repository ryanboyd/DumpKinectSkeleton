# Kinect Skeleton Joint Data Dump #

## Description

Dumps color camera stream and joints data from the first kinect skeleton found.

The original project can be found here:
https://github.com/sebtoun/DumpKinectSkeleton

I have added a small bit of code that calculates some additional joint info at the time of output, along with hand states.
